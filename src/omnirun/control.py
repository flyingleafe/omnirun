"""The impure ``Control`` driver — the one surface a client touches.

``Control`` is the counterpart to the pure :func:`omnirun.scheduler.tick`: where
``tick`` computes *what* should happen from an immutable snapshot, ``Control``
performs the I/O that makes it happen — reconciling live provider statuses,
reserving capacity, calling ``provider.place``, committing/realizing the budget,
and persisting every state transition through the :class:`~omnirun.state.store.Store`.

The split is deliberate and load-bearing (spec §7):

* ``tick`` is a **pure function** — no I/O, ``now`` a parameter, decided solely
  by ``slot.capabilities.satisfies(req)``. It never runs a backend.
* ``Control`` is the **impure driver** — every side effect lives here. It CALLS
  ``tick``; it never reimplements the matching logic.

``run_tick`` runs the spec §7 loop in order: **reconcile** provider statuses
into job states first (so freed capacity is visible to the tick), **gather**
the slots offered by each provider, **load** the budget ledger, **tick** to get
decisions, then **enact** each decision (hold / reserve+place). No control
plane is mandatory — ``run_tick`` is a plain method the daemonless CLI or the
optional daemon calls on whatever cadence it likes.

        slots — ``reserve`` is the atomic capacity truth, so an over-emitted
        place simply fails reserve gracefully. A provider whose ``offer`` raises
        is treated as offering nothing this tick (circuit-breaker-lite) rather
        than crashing the tick. ``only_providers`` (daemon restriction groups)
        narrows which providers are asked; ``None`` asks them all.
